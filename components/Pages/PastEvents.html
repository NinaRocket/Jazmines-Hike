          <p class="section-text" style="font-size: 18px;">A huge thank you to everyone who came out and donated blood at Jazmines Blood Drive. We successfully collected 27 units of blood that will be used to help save lives. Jazmine had so many blood product transfusion, we lost count. There are so many children just like Jazmine always in need of blood. We will be hosting future blood drives to help save more lives. If you have space big enough to host please reach out so we can coordinate Jazmineâ€™s Blood Drive

            We want to say thank you to everyone who participated in Jazmines Memorial Hike on May 5, 2024, at North Mountain Visitor Center, whether in person or virtually. Your presence and support made the event truly special.

            We're thrilled to announce that we had three raffle winners and raised just over <span style="font-weight: 600;">$1,000</span> to help families impacted by pediatric cancer. Your generosity is making a real difference in the lives of these families.

          <p class="section-text" style="font-size: 18px;">Thank you to everyone who came out and joined us for a fun filled afternoon painting rocks for Jazmines Traveling Rocks. We are happy to announced we raised enough money to provide dinner for families that are currently staying in the hospital with their child that is undergoing cancer treatments. Please keep a look out for future rock painting events so we can provide more dinners to these families

                Thank you to those who donated to the toy drive! We successfully donated <span class="animate-charcter">30 toys </span> to HopeKids! <a href="https://hopekids.org">HopeKids</a> is a wonderful nonprofit that provides events and classes for sick children and their families. They still include our family even after Jazmine has passed. Since a lot of the kiddos are quarantined at home because of their weakened immune system or in a hospital, I wanted to do another toy drive along with checking and sanitizing items that may need to be needed. Everything donated was given to the HopeKids organization who make sure those in need will receive them.
